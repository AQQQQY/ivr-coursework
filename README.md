# Information
I have an approved extension until **3 DEC 2021 at 16:00**.

I do not have a partner. **Working Individually**.
My previous progress was uploaded to another account. I did something to my laptop which erased all histories, cookies, and login informations. Among them is the password to that GitHub account. I could not reset the password as I cannot access the associated email any more. So I had to upload my current updates to another personal GitHub account of mine.

Anyways the following are the updates prior to the first one you see in this account. A total of 4 commits.
