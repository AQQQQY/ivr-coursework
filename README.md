# Information
I have an approved extension until **3 DEC 2021 at 16:00**.

I do not have a partner. **Working Individually**.

I am only uploading the files in the src folders. If you wish to see the entire thing, please refer to the `ivr_assignment.zip`.

My previous progress was uploaded to another account. I did something to my laptop which erased all histories, cookies, and login informations, along with other disturbing damages. Among them is the password to that GitHub account. I could not reset the password as I cannot access the associated email any more. So I had to upload my current updates to another personal GitHub account of mine.
